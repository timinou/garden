# Projection

The discourse subtly evolves over time, progressively including more concepts that explain our inner workings with more clarity.

One concept that is dear to me, and that I don't see talked about often enough, is the concept of projection.

> *Projection*: when we choose to believe in a narrative that puts the responsilibity away from the present self (consciously or unconsciously). 

## Projection happens everywhere

Anytime I talk about anything that isn't me and now, I'm possibly projecting. It's a defence mechanism against the burden of being responsible for ourselves fully. When we don't acknowledge the responsibility that comes with self-agency (and only want to recognise the freedom of it), we end up building stories that justify why the focus of our attention shouldn't be ourselves, but instead our friends, our enemies, society, or even our past/future selves. For example:

- when you give advice to others, how often is it the advice you're seeking to implement in your life? I'm particularly guilty of this one, and I'm saddened whenever I realise I'm doing it. I end up not listening to the person's feelings, miring myself in intellectual problem-solving, I expend effort convincing others of what I need to do in my own life, and I don't end up understanding what's missing for me to be the person that I advocate others to become.
- when you blame who you are on the past--whether it's your parents, your education, or even traumas... Are you still being actively gaslit by your past? Probably. If you didn't feel like these past events affect you now, would you feel negatively towards them? There's of course a balance to strike: our past influences our habits and beliefs, and it takes time to undo and accept. At the same time, we can be reveling in sadness because we're used to it.

<!-- TODO The comfort zone can be where your sadness lies -->
